## Gitflow
### The gitFlow workflow is a workflow that helps the software development process stay continuous. There are different branches where code is features are developed, released, and hotfixed. In the development branch, code for the project is developed. In the hotfix branch, all hotfixes being done for the code are found there. In the release branch, the latest release of the application is developed. There is also the features branch where each new feature is pushed into a central repository.

## Git Commands

## Repository 

#### A repository contains all of our project's files and each file's revision history along with number of commits and updates made by users.


## Clone

#### Clone in git is used to copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.
`code`
`git clone <link>`

# Fork

#### A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

# Branch

#### A branch in Git repository is a pointer that is able to move and provide commits. Default branch in a newly created repository is Master, which is the main root of where the stored resources can be found.
`code`
`git branch <new_branch_name>



# Commit

`code`
`git commit`



# Checkout

#### Checkout command helps to switch between branches

`code`

`code`
` git status `

# Push
