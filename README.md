# Git Collaboration

##Repository 

####A repository contains all of our project's files and each file's revision history along with number of commits and updates made by users.

##Clone

#### Clone in git is used to copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.
